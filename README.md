# Examples of Kalman filtering

At the moment this repository contains only one example of scalar version of the Kalman filter. See the Jupyter notebook for more information about the example. The free body diagram mentioned in the notebook will be added once I get the notebook rendering to work correctly. For now, see the car.png file.
